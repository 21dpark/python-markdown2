A note along those lines, sent from you to your friends, can make an
especially effective contribution to the petition.  A successful
petition is a grassroots collaborative effort, and now it's your turn. 
The power of the Internet is in your hands -- so spread the word!

Note, however, that in helping to promote this petition you are expressly prohibited from sending unsolicited bulk mail messages ("junk mail" or "spam").  This includes, but is not limited to, bulk-mailing of commercial advertising, information announcements, and political tracts.  Such material may only be sent to those who have specifically requested it.

Confirmation in Error?

On the other hand, if you believe you have received this confirmation of
signature in error, and, if you received the email _directly_ from
PetitionOnline.com, then please forward THIS ENTIRE MESSAGE, with
a brief explanation, to:

   support@PetitionOnline.org

An erroneous signature confirmation is most often caused by a typographic error by a legitimate signer.  With millions of email addresses on the internet, there are very many addresses that are only one letter apart.  However, an erroneous signature confirmation could also be caused by abuse of the petition system, so all confirmation errors will be investigated carefully.

By the way, we don't keep any email distribution lists associated with petition signers at PetitionOnline.com, so there is never any mail list here you'd need to be unsubscribed from.  

We honor you for the courage of your convictions.  And we thank you for participating in the free and open expression of public opinion.

Best wishes,

Kevin Matthews
Director
